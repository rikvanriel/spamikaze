	TODO items for spamikaze


For version 1.0:
  * integrate evidence fetching cgi script
  * IPv6 support (in MySQL 3 & Postgresql 3 table schemas)

For later versions:
  * integrate query statistics
  * sharing IP addresses with multiple spamikaze lists
  * (maybe) automatic escalation to netblocks if a lot of spam
    is received from netblocks

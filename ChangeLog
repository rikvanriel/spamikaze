	* p2p-design: 	Simple spamikaze data exchange design
		May 14, 2004

		Overview

	Every spamikaze installation receives a limited amount of spam
	to its spamtraps.  This is a good thing since it limits the amount
	of resources (ab)used, but it increases the possibility of a
	spamikaze installation not learning of an ongoing spam run until
	that spam run hits its own spamtraps.  At that time the human
	users, who the spamikaze is supposed to shield, may have already
	received the spam in question.

	To improve the chances of spamikaze blocking spam sent to the
	users, it would be useful if there was a low overhead way for
	spamikaze installations to learn of spamtrap events at other
	spamikaze setups. This way mail from spam sources could be
	blocked before its own spam traps (and users) are spammed.

	This proposal contains ideas on how to implement such a
	mechanism, addressing these areas:
	- Data Exchange Model
	- High Level Protocol
	- Protocol Details and Extensibility
	- Trust Model
	- Database and Security Considerations

	If you have any comments on this proposal, please email the
	spamikaze mailing list, <spamikaze@nl.linux.org>.


		Data Exchange Model

	The basic model is client/server, with the twist that any
	participant can be both client and server, though this is in
	no way necessary.  There will be two simple programs, one for
	the client (getting information from another spamikaze system)
	and one for the server (giving information to clients).

	The server will listen on a predetermined network port.  The client
	will connect to the server.  For simplicity (and security concerns)
	the first implementation will probably follow a one process per
	connection model, possibly using (x)inetd for access control.


		High Level Protocol

	There are basically three distinct phases of the data exchange:
	initial handshake, synchronisation and live feed.

	Initial handshake:  during this phase the server informs the
	client of a number of its identity, giving details like the
	name of the spamikaze list, the base URL for listing data,
	the email of the list maintainer, etc...

	Synchronisation:  the client asks the server for all spamtrap
	events that happened on the server since a certain timestamp,
	usually the timestamp of the last spamtrap event received from
	this particular server.  The server then proceeds to send the
	requested information to the client, potentially limiting the
	number of events sent to a certain number to prevent resource
	waste.

	Live feed:  after the synchronisation is done, the server will
	automatically send new spamtrap events to the client as they
	happen.  This could either be a live feed from the spamtrap
	software, or a periodic polling of the database.  The client
	does not need to send any requests, since the server is still
	"sending all spamtrap events since a certain timestamp", like
	the client requested in the synchronisation phase.

	Using this model we can synchronise both live events and the
	events that happened during the time where client and server
	were not connected to each other, using the same connection
	and protocol.


		Protocol Details and Extensibility

	In order to ease debuggability, extensibility, ease of programming
	and - through the former - security, spamikaze will use an RFC 822
	style plain text format for serving data to the client.

	RFC 822 style messages have the advantages of being easy to parse
	and of the client being able to ignore messages of unknown types,
	or message content of an unknown type.  This means that the protocol
	can be extended without the need for every spamikaze installation
	to upgrade to the new protocol simultaneously.

	The following are two examples of what a version 1 spamikaze
	message could look like, with all messages separated by an
	empty line:

	Type: Server-ID
	Spamikaze-name: PSBL
	Base-URL: "http://psbl.surriel.com/listing?ip=@IP@"

	Type: spamtrap
	IP: 1.2.3.4
	Time: 1084588813

	In this case, the message type can easily be identified by the
	"Type:" header; the rest of the message can be parsed by a
	routine that knows how to deal with this type of message, parsing
	the headers it knows about and ignoring the rest.  If the minimum
	data needed to process an event isn't present, the client can
	either ignore the message or trigger an error handling event like
	reinitialising the connection to the server.


		Trust Model

	Trust considerations are different for the client and the server
	side.  A server could decide to let anybody have information on
	which IP addresses are hitting its spamtraps, in effect giving
	the whole world read-only access to its database.  The main
	reasons for access control on the server side would be resource
	use and the possibility that a client could learn the identity
	of the server's spamtraps.

	A client, on the other hand, would only want to import data into
	its own spamikaze database from sources it trusts.  After all,
	the data being imported has influence on which email will be
	blocked.

	In this model it is important that each server only exports the
	data from its own spamtraps.  It is easy for a client to trust
	the spamtraps of one server, but a much bigger leap of faith to
	trust the data of whoever it is the server pulls data from.
	Additionally, passing through the data received from others
	creates the possibility of spamikaze installations passing the
	same messages around in an infinite loop, quickly exhausting
	resources everywhere.


		Database and Security Considerations

	The server side of the spamikaze network communications software
	only needs SELECT rights, to inform the client of spamtrap events.
	Assuming other standard precautions are followed, the potential
	for security problems with the server side should be minimal.

	Even though the client should only connect to trusted servers,
	the security risk on this side is bigger.  This is mostly due
	to the fact that the client software needs to have the ability
	to INSERT records with spamtrap event data into the database.

	Security risk and recoverability can be limited by not allowing
	the client to UPDATE records in the spamtrap events table, as
	well as by clearly identifying the source of every spamtrap
	event.  When a client decides to no longer trust a particular
	server, it will be easy to purge the database of all spamtrap
	events from that particular server.

	The database table with spamtrap events would contain the fields
	ID, IP address, timestamp and spamikaze_id, the last being an ID
	denoting from which server the data was obtained.  There would be
	a smaller table containing information about the spamikaze lists
	from which information is being obtained (the servers).

			$Id: ChangeLog,v 1.3 2004/05/28 00:30:43 cor Exp $


	In order to facilitate more flexible blocklisting, expiry, removal and
	whitelisting policies, a database redesign is necessary.  Before we can
	come up with such a new design, however, we should think about exactly
	what we want to store in the database.

	If you have ideas for other things that need to be stored, please email
	spamikaze@nl.linux.org or commit your idea to the list below.

	Data to store:
	- IP address of spam sending host
	- time each spam arrived
	- time of each IP address removal
	- number of spams received from each IP address
	- number of spams received from each IP address since last removal
	- time the IP address will automatically expire from the database,
	  calculated by the listing&expiry policy at the time the spam is
	  received
	- first characters of the subject of the spam (small enough to avoid
	  most unique tokens, 30 chars?)
	- email addresses to whitelist
	- number of IP addresses listed, per /24 (updated at listing and
	  unlisting time, used for easy block escalation)
	- same for /16 and /8 blocks, but for statistics only
	- the country each IP address is in, for statistics
	- the host name (from reverse DNS) for each IP address, for statistics
	  and per-domain queries


	The design of the database tables should be done once we have the
	requirements, or maybe earlier if the new design is flexible enough ;)

	Sendmail.pl will not need to expire by itself anymore, it will just need

	* /home/CVS/spamikaze/spamikaze/scripts/gethostname.pl:

	This will need one more additional table:

	CREATE TABLE `country` (
	  `id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
	    `country` char(2) NOT NULL default '',
	      PRIMARY KEY  (`id`),
	        UNIQUE KEY `idx_country` (`country`)
	        ) TYPE=MyISAM;

	and another field in the spammers table:

	ALTER TABLE spammers ADD c_id SMALLINT NOT NULL;

	It will store the countries from where the spammers will
	are spamming. This alteration and the one for the fqdn will
	be used to setup an admin/abuse interface in the future.

	More details later.

	Regards,

	Hans Wolters

	* /home/CVS/spamikaze/spamikaze/scripts/expire.pl:

	Ok, this is a new expire that will use different options and will look
	for hostnames, etc....

	What do you need for it to work:

	A new table fqdn:

	CREATE TABLE `fqdn` (
	  `id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
	    `hostname` varchar(200) NOT NULL default '',
	      PRIMARY KEY  (`id`),
	        UNIQUE KEY `idx_hostname` (`hostname`(40))
	        ) TYPE=MyISAM;

	An altered spammers table:

	ALTER TABLE spammers ADD fqdn_id INT NOT NULL;

	What will expire.pl do:

	It will look for hostnames and ranges that will not be
	expired. Empty hostnames (blackholes) will not be expired
	anyhow. Currently I have a working setup that will start
	the expire at 7 days and look for a new variable ($extratime)
	for the additional expire time for attempt 2 and higher.

	Beware of using this since you need to fill the fqdn table
	first. Some altered scripts for this will follow.

	* /home/CVS/spamikaze/spamikaze/scripts/postfix.pl, /home/CVS/spamikaze/spamikaze/scripts/sendmail.pl:

	postfix: deleted the ticks line, the new expire.pl will be used to

	Sets the fqdn_id from the info in the new table. I will add a list of
	hostnames in a gzipped dump of my table.

	* /home/CVS/spamikaze/spamikaze/scripts/sendmail.pl:

	Sendmail.pl will not need to expire by itself anymore, it will just need
	to fetch the visible ip numbers.

	* /home/CVS/spamikaze/spamikaze/scripts/gethostname.pl:

	This will need one more additional table:

	CREATE TABLE `country` (
	  `id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
	    `country` char(2) NOT NULL default '',
	      PRIMARY KEY  (`id`),
	        UNIQUE KEY `idx_country` (`country`)
	        ) TYPE=MyISAM;

	and another field in the spammers table:

	ALTER TABLE spammers ADD c_id SMALLINT NOT NULL;

	It will store the countries from where the spammers will
	are spamming. This alteration and the one for the fqdn will
	be used to setup an admin/abuse interface in the future.

	More details later.

	Regards,

	Hans Wolters

	* /home/CVS/spamikaze/spamikaze/scripts/expire.pl:

	Ok, this is a new expire that will use different options and will look
	for hostnames, etc....

	What do you need for it to work:

	A new table fqdn:

	CREATE TABLE `fqdn` (
	  `id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
	    `hostname` varchar(200) NOT NULL default '',
	      PRIMARY KEY  (`id`),
	        UNIQUE KEY `idx_hostname` (`hostname`(40))
	        ) TYPE=MyISAM;

	An altered spammers table:

	ALTER TABLE spammers ADD fqdn_id INT NOT NULL;

	What will expire.pl do:

	It will look for hostnames and ranges that will not be
	expired. Empty hostnames (blackholes) will not be expired
	anyhow. Currently I have a working setup that will start
	the expire at 7 days and look for a new variable ($extratime)
	for the additional expire time for attempt 2 and higher.

	Beware of using this since you need to fill the fqdn table
	first. Some altered scripts for this will follow.

	* /home/CVS/spamikaze/spamikaze/scripts/postfix.pl, /home/CVS/spamikaze/spamikaze/scripts/sendmail.pl:

	postfix: deleted the ticks line, the new expire.pl will be used to

	* /home/CVS/spamikaze/config.pl, /home/CVS/spamikaze/expire.pl:
	ok gang,

	This is an example of how the expire could be. I dropped them in the
	main dir and will remove them once I had comments.

	The idea.

	In the config.pl we have a @DONTEXPIRE. This will enable us
	to make sure certain ranges will not expire.

	The expire.pl should be run seperate (doesn't expire yet) and
	will expire ipnr's that are not listed in @DONTEXPIRE and are:

	* listed once in the db and are older then time() - $ticks.
	* expire ipnumbers listed <= $maxspamsperip and ore older then time()
	  and $ticks.

	Calculation for the ipnumbers with more then one spam:
	$bonustime = $spamtime + ($ticks * $total);
	If this is <= time() they can expire.

	The $maxspamperip will enable some of us to run a real dangerous list :-)

	The idea would be to run this expire instead of having sendmail.pl
	and named.pl looking at the the expiretime. They could just select
	everything that's not 0/FALSE (visible field).

	Any comments are welcome.

	Hans

	p.s. $_ will not list ipnr's starting with 0, we need some more bugfixing.

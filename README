What is Spamikaze?
==================

Spamikaze is a set of scripts that will help you to automate
spamblocking.

The idea behind Spamikaze is to offer people running mailserver
a set of scripts that will not only block spam but will allow 
persons that get blocked to delist. This process is completely
autmated and could be done by running their own RBL or mailserver.

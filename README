What is Spamikaze?
==================

Spamikaze is a set of scripts that will help you to automate
spamblocking.

The idea behind Spamikaze is to offer people running mailservers
a set of scripts that will not only block spam but will allow 
persons that get blocked to delist.  This process is completely
automated and could be done by running their own DNSBL or mailserver.

You can find more information on the Spamikaze web site:

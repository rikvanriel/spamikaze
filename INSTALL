Online Documentation
--------------------

Most of the Spamikaze documentation should be present online by now,
at http://spamikaze.org/   This document gives some extra
hints and hints on how to upgrade from the previous version.

PostgreSQL
----------

The PostgreSQL database schema is more efficient than the ones
currently available for MySQL. PostgreSQL also seems to be better at
handling large queries while other transactions are happening. This
makes PostgreSQL the recommended database for Spamikaze.

MySQL
-----

Important. If you are updating from the previous version of Spamikaze
the please read the following. If not then move on to the install part 
of this document.

Update Spamikaze
----------------

To update from the Spamikaze version .1 you will need three extra
tables in the spamikaze database. This is simply done by importing
the update dump in mysql.

    mysql -u root -p spamikaze < spamikaze-mysql-update.sql

Next you need to make sure you have a backup of your current database
before you run the update script which is located in the scripts 
directory. This update will import the current entries which are all
stored in the spammers table into the ipnumber and ipentries tables.


Install Spamikaze
-----------------

We are assuming you already have mysql installed and running. If not
then please get a version for your OS and install it with the guide-
lines of that package.

* Creating a new database for spamikaze:

At the prompt you can use mysqladmin to create a new database.

    mysqladmin -u root -p create spamikaze 

You will be prompted for the mysql root password, enter it. If no
errors are shown you need to login as mysql root to the database
server in order to grant privileges to the new spamikaze directory:

    mysql -u root -p mysql

Again you will be prompted for a password, enter it.

Once you are in you should grant privileges with to a user at either 
localhost or a webserver able to access this mysql server. It is not
recommended to use a remote server without using some sort of encryption.
The following example will use user spamikaze at localhost. You need to
grant select, insert and update privileges at least. It is recommended 
to hold back any other privileges at this time:

mysql> GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON spamikaze.* TO
        spamikaze@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 's0m3leetpassw0rd';

Once this is done you only need to flush the privileges:

mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

The last thing to do with mysql is read the spamikaze.sql into the newly
created database.

    mysql -u root -p spamikaze < /path/spamikaze-mysql.sql

Again you will be prompted for a password, enter it.


Webserver
---------

The most common webserver around for the *nix platform is Apache. To run
either the cgi or the php 4 scripts you will have to make sure apache can
handle them. 

The php scripts are using the newly introduced superglobals and can be run
with register_globals set off:

http://nl3.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.predefined.php


For installation guides on both Apache and PHP please see the following url's:

http://nl3.php.net/manual/en/installation.php
http://httpd.apache.org/


Spamikaze 
---------

Setting up the scripts:

The first thing you need to do is check the location of the perl shebang.
Spamikaze uses #!/usr/bin/perl. If it isn't located there you will either
have to links perl to that location or alter the shebangs in all the perl
scripts. For the php files you will use you will need to edit the 
include_once location to point it to the correct config.php.

Next choose a location where the scripts could be located on your system.
Copy config.php, passivetrap.pl, sendmail.pl and named.pl to that location.

Store the php/cgi scripts in your webdir/cgi-bin.


Mail and Database Scripts
-------------------------

Please check the online documentation:

http://spamikaze.org/


Almost done, setting up the spamtraps and cronjobs: 

a. Setting up spamtraps using aliases in your /etc/aliases by piping them
   to passivetrap.pl. An example:

passive:        |/path/passivetrap.pl

nomailwanted: passive
MUNGED: passive
uns:    passive

Once you run newaliases it will use passivetrap to handle all incoming mail.


Importing older spam:
---------------------

With formail you can import your current spamarchive into the database server:

    formail -s /path/passivetrap.pl < /path/spamarchive

On older machines it might take a long time, depending on the number of
spams and your hardware.

If you wish to import mail from different files then the following shellcode
will enable you to do it:

for I in *
        do
                formail -s /path/passivetrap.pl < $I
        done

Be aware that importing single testentries located in mbox files without 
using formail will trigger the mailer daemon notification and will not 
import the ipaddress

Enjoy,

The Spamikaze team.
